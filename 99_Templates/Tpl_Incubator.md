# Incubator layer — {{title}}

> This is a *second pass*, not a rewrite. Read the Inbox layer below, then add only what became clearer.

## 1) What changed since capture
<!-- One or two bullets: new insight, new constraint, or a corrected assumption. -->
- 
-

<!-- If you catch yourself rethinking, add it here and wait for the next review. -->
- 
- 
- 

## 8) Next review decision
<!-- Choose the smallest honest step. Not everything deserves promotion. -->
- Status:
  - [ ] Keep incubating
  - [ ] Promote to project
  - [ ] Archive
- Why (one blunt line):
