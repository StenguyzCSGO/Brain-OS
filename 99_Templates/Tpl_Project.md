# Project layer — {{title}}

> Promotion means commitment. This layer is about *building*, not rethinking the concept below.

## Links
- Repo:
- Design / docs (optional):
- Related note(s):

## 1) Commitment check
<!-- Read the Incubator layer below. This section is only: “am I actually doing this now?” -->
<!-- If you’re trying to convince yourself, that’s usually a “not yet”. Be blunt and kind. -->
- I am committing to ship a v0 because:
  - 
- This is NOT a project if (honest tripwire):
  - 

## 2) Definition of done (v0)
<!-- A small finish line you can point to. Avoid vague words like “better”, “smart”, “robust”. -->
<!-- If you can’t describe v0 without adding more clauses, shrink it. -->
- v0 is done when:
  - 

## 3) MVP scope (small, checkable)
<!-- Only what must exist for v0 to be real. One verb per checkbox. -->
<!-- Keep it end-to-end, not a pile of parts. -->
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

### Explicitly not doing (anti-scope)
<!-- This is how you prevent “just one more feature”. Add the tempting stuff. -->
- 
- 

## 4) First execution steps
<!-- Start with the thinnest end-to-end slice, even if ugly. Momentum beats elegance here. -->
- [ ] Create repo + basic README
- [ ] Set up local dev environment
- [ ] Build the thinnest end-to-end slice
- [ ] Capture the first user-visible output (screenshot / CLI output / URL)

## 5) Tech choices (keep brief)
<!-- Just enough to avoid re-deciding later. Optional: leave blank if it’s still fluid. -->
- Language:
- Framework:
- Data / storage:
- Hosting / runtime (if any):

## 6) Risks & unknowns (actionable)
<!-- Only items that could block shipping v0. Turn worries into a next step if possible. -->
- 
- 

## 7) Decisions log
<!-- Tiny entries that prevent future confusion. Write what you chose and why (one line). -->
- {{date}} — 

## 8) Dev journal
<!-- Progress notes, not a diary. Small updates are enough. -->
- {{date}} — Project started.
